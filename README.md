# IAM Permissions expander
I had a hard time seeing the effect of IAM wildcards like "ecs:*Task*" in the IAM policy simulator. This script expands the wildcards to all possible actions and resources, so you can see what the policy actually allows. There is a copy button in the output to copy the expanded policy to your clipboard.
